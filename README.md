# ArduinoPrank

A quick code I wrote to prank my parents powered by an Arduino.

When the target opens a door, a servo will open up and release whatever projectile you want, whether its marbles(don't recomend), beads, beans, rice, or powder. 

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

Using a reed switch, an Arduino Uno, a servo, one 330 ohm resistor and a handful of wires, you can make this too. 

Connect all of your parts as shown in this diagram. Please note the program I used does not have a reed switch, so I have replaced it with a button to represent it. To wire the sensor, remove the button, take the reed switch and connect one of its terminals to F16, and the other to D14.
