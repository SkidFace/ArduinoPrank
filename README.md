# ArduinoPrank

A quick code I wrote to prank my parents powered by an Arduino.

When the target opens a door, a servo will open up and release whatever projectile you want, whether its marbles(don't recomend), beads, beans, rice, or powder. 

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

Using a reed switch, an Arduino Uno, a servo, and a handfull of wires, you can make this too.
